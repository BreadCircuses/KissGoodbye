# KissGoodbye?
* A tool for entrepreneurs/account managers.
* Predicts the amount of time that will be spent negotiating for a new contract. 
* Uses regression.
* Named after Henry Kissinger.
* Also tries to predict the right time to cut our losses when the negotiation is not leading anywhere.

Negotiation for a new contract always takes longer than we want and often longer than we expect.

The more time we spend in negotiation, the more emotionally invested we become in the project. 

But sometimes the project falls through, no matter how hard we tried. 
Maybe there was a change of management in the company and our project received low priority, or maybe our price was too high - 
we may never know.

**Hypothesis # 1**

The amount of time spent negotiating for a new contract can be predicted using least-squares linear regression,
where the budget is an independent variable and the amount of time is a response variable.

**Hypothesis # 2**

With negotiations that don't lead to winning the contract 
there is a moment in time when is it reasonable to stop spending resourses on this negotiation. 
WHEN?
