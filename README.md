# KissGoodbye
A tool for entrepreneurs/account managers.
Predicts the amount of time spent negotiating for a new contract. Uses regression.
Named after Henry Kissinger.

Negotiation for a new contract always takes longer than we want and often longer than we expect.

The more time we spend in negotiation, the more emotionally invested we become in the project. 

But sometimes the project falls through, no matter how hard we tried. 
Maybe there was a change of management in the company and our project received low priority, or maybe our price was too high - 
we may never know.

Before it happens, how do we know our chance of getting the contract is low enough? 
When is the right time to cut our losses? 
How can we make the whole process more predictable overall?
